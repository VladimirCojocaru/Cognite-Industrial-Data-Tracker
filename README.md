# Cognite-Industrial-Data-Tracker

This project aims to help people visualize data provided by the Open Industrial platform and perform basic operations on it. 
The project uses a relational database to store the data which is provided to the user via the frontend using graphs, making it much easier to understand what is happening and at what time.


In order to work, some folders with .json and .env files are also necessary, these being excluded because they have the data for connection to cognite api, keycloak and database.
And also, docker compose and reverse proxy are made for Windows(not Linux).
